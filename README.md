    * When adding a new employee - the user has the option to add a new role and department as part of the process
    * Lists have the option of cancelling out of the process and returning to main menu
    * Formatted headings and confirmation messages to reduce cognitive buren on where/which task is being performed

## Installation

1. Clone or fork the repository
2. Run the below in concole install necessary packages
    * MySQL2 (Major version 3),
    * Inquirer (Major version 8),    
    * dotenv (Major version 8) 
```
npm i
```
3. After NPM packages have been installed, you'll need to set up your MySQL database for the application to read and write to. Log into MySQL2:
```
myself -u root -p
```
4. Within mysql2 - create the datbase with the schema provided, run the below command in the root folder (the below is the relative path):
```
source ./db/schema.sql
```
5. Optional - you can seed some data into the database while you are in mysql2 (Skip this step if you are going to use real data)
```
source ./db/seeds.sql
```
6. Exit MySQL2:
```
quit
```
7. You can run the application once packages have been installed and the database is created. Run the below in the CLI:
```
node index.js
```

## Usage

Once in, you will immediately be presented with the Main Menu which serves as the "home page" to the application.

From here it is a matter of navigating through the processes to view, add, remove records from the database following prompts on the screen. Once processes are progressed to completion (or cancelled) the application will return back to the main menu to await the next process.
